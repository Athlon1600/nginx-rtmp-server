# Video Streaming Server

Self-host your own streaming server without relying on any external and expensive services (like **Amazon IVS**).

See a demo here - https://demo.streamplanet.tv/

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Athlon1600/nginx-rtmp-server.git
```

Next, you need Docker.

**Windows**  
If you are testing this from your local Windows computer, download Docker from here:
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

**Linux**  
Install Docker with just this one command:

```shell
bash <(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Athlon1600/nginx-rtmp-server/master/install.sh)
```

Once Docker is installed, run:

```shell
docker-compose up --build -d
```

and that is it! This will launch two services:

- HTTP Nginx Server on http://localhost:8090
- RTMP Ingest Server on `rtmp://localhost:1935`

## Usage

Once the two services are up and running, you can now start streaming to your newly launched RTMP server at this endpoint:

```shell
rtmp://localhost:1935/live/{stream_key}
```

`{stream_key}` can be anything you want. In all the examples below we just use `test`.

If you are using OBS, point your streaming settings to:

```shell
rtmp://localhost:1935/live/test
```

otherwise, you can just stream any mp4-like video file using `ffmpeg`:

```shell
ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -nostdin -re -i "video.mp4" -copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/live/test
```

Your stream is now ready to be consumed via HTTP as `.m3u8` playlist by any supporting client such as VLC Media Player:
- `Media -> Open Network Stream -> Network`
- Paste the link there:

```shell
http://localhost:8090/hls/test/master.m3u8
```

or you can embed that video stream on your website by using `hls.js` Javascript library:

## Technical Notes

Powered by RTMP module for nginx.

The original codebase stopped receiving updates years ago:  
https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module

so we will be using this fork instead:
